-   **Part I - TypeScript**: Convert the project from JavaScript to TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience.
-   **Part II - SQL**: Integrate SQL databases for robust and scalable data management.
-   **Part III - App Router**: Implement an advanced app router for better navigation and user experience
-   **Part IV - Server Components**: Utilize server components to optimize performance and server-side rendering.

## Development

### Local Development

To run project commands locally, you need to install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

You can then use the following commands:

-   `npm run dev` to start the development server.
-   `npm run build` to create a production build.
-   `npm run start` to start the production build.
-   `npm run test` to run the tests in watch mode.

> 💡 This project requires a bundler. You can use `npm run dev` to start the development server. You can then view the project in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The Live Preview Extension for Visual Studio Code will **not** work for this project.
